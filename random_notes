BACKTESTING

NIFTY options broadly has 3 diff periods
2/1 to 3/31 and I think now where our setting is just too good 200% in 2 months 
10/1/22 to 2/1 where it was good returns, 100% in 3 months:-) just not sky rockting
5/1 to 10/1 where it serously underperformed

What defines these periods ? 

Is it seasonal ? this month every year ? 
Does it have to do with Adani crash in Feb ? 
Does it have to do with general pullback / fII flows etc ? 
If we can relate some macro / long term forces that influence the period then we may be able to pick 
the best strategies for specfiic periods

Things to try -- 

seperate out the analytics on a day by day basis for more acurate apples to apples back test vs real 

Try OBV or something else, I think in long term upgrending markets, the sharp declines where we exit and lose happen at low volume -- HOLLLDD THOSE 

Get the prev day or week (LT MEGA TREND -- or 200 period super trend).  If that is positive then add a multiplier to short term positions consistent with the trend, and divide the multiplier for positions counter long term trend

Compare the sudden wierd dips where to lose to the underlying NIFTY ? Do those only happen in the options or also in underlying NIFTY ? That could be another way to filter those out
